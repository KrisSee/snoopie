# Snoopie üê∂

** Still checking port to Firefox **

A (very simple) tracker for popular tracking services, provided as a Firefox web extension.
Forked from https://github.com/davidbyttow/snoopie and minimal changes for Firefox compatibility

This extension only lets you know when it detects popular tracking services in use on the active tab in Firefox.
